## üíª Local Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
    * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/guychuk/matrix-calculator.git
    cd matrix-calculator
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm install ts-node --save-dev  # For running TypeScript files directly
    ```

## üß™ Usage

1.  **Executing Calculations:**
    * Write your matrix calculations in a `.ts` file.
    * Use `ts-node` to run the script:  `ts-node your_script_name.ts`
    * **Example:** To run `examples/fib.ts`:

        ```bash
        ts-node examples/fib.ts
        ```

        **Output:**

        ```
        Example of calculating Fibonacci numbers using matrices:
         fib(0) = 0
         fib(1) = 1
         fib(2) = 1
         fib(3) = 2
         fib(4) = 3
         fib(5) = 5
         fib(6) = 8
         fib(7) = 13
         fib(8) = 21
         fib(9) = 34
        ```

2.  **Running Tests:**

    Use Jest to ensure the library functions correctly:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
